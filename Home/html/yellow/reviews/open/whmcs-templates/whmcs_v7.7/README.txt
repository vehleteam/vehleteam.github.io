3. Refresh the Client Area

Notes
==============================================

To update the WHMCS template Header and footer, Open "header.tpl" and "footer.tpl" inside "/OrDomain" folder and edit accordingly. All the css overrides in "css/style_ordomain.css" file.

You can also copy paste from the HTML page to match with your website and update the links.

If you like to rename WHMCS template folder name, just use only letters and numbers (according to WHMCS).
For example "myhost" is OK. But "my-host" is not OK (WHMCS will be unable to see the specific template in admin).
